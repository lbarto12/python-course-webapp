<p>Python has many useful built-in functions that we use to run and debug our code. </p>
<p>The most basic of these is the print directive, try printing `Hello World` by running:</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>("Hello World")
</code>
<p>
    python also has some useful functions for capturing user data, such as input, 
    but we can't use it here because the code is run on a server :(. However, the syntax looks like this:
</p>
<code><var>response</var> = <fun>input</fun>("what is your favourite color")
</code>
