<p>
    What you are about to see doesn't actually exist in python, 
    but has been implemented in this app to provide a more
    cohesive programming experience.
</p>

<p>
    Here I will give you a simple question, and your answer will have to work when run with `all` the `inputs` listed, 
    and provide the corresponding `outputs` listed.
</p>

<p>
    Your `inputs` will be `unpacked` from the backend into the `variables` you are provided.
    You will write the problem `only once`, and the app will run it `multiple times` with `each input` to check if your answer is correct.
</p>

<p>
    The `inputs` you are given will be labeled by `type` in the comment above them.
</p>

<p>
    `Testcases` will be used extensively in future modules, so it is important to understand how they evaluate your answers.
</p>

<p>
    You question here is to `add` the `two numbers` you are given, and `print` the `sum`.
