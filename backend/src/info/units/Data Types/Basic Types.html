<p>Python has a variety of different variable types to store data. At a later point we'll even go over how to create your own!</p>

<p>Here are a few simple ones:</p>

<p>A `int` is a number with no decimal places, such as `1` and `2`, and is created by assigning such a number to a variable name: </p>
<code><var>x</var> = 10</code>

<p>A `float` is a number with decimal places, and is created by assigning a number with decimals to a variable name: </p>
<code><var>x</var> = 1.234</code>

<p>In Python3, we actually have the ability to add types to variables by stating them directly prior to assignment: </p>
<code><var>x</var>: <class>int</class> = 10
<var>y</var>: <class>float</class> = 1.234</code>
</code>

<p>If you are working in Python3 it is always a good idea to type your variables!</p>

<p>You can print the type a variable using: </p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(<fun>type</fun>(<var>x</var>))</code>

<p>Given the variabes `x` and `y`, print the types of `x` and `y` on a single line.</p>
