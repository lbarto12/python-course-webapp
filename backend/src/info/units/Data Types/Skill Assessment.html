    These are the `data types` we have covered so far:
</p>
<code><cmt>Numbers</cmt>, <cmt>Strings</cmt>, <cmt>Booleans</cmt>, <cmt>Lists</cmt>, <cmt>Tuples</cmt>, <cmt>Sets</cmt>, <cmt>Dictionaries</cmt>
</code>

<p>
    Now we will test your knowledge of these `data types` with a `skill assessment`.
    for each answer, print the answer on a new line.
</p>

<p>
    1. Create a two `numbers` one `int` and one `float` such that the answer sums to 5.25
</p>
<p>
    2. Create two `strings` that contains the words `Hello` and `World` respectively 
    and print them such that the answer is `Hello World` on the same line.
</p>
<p>
    3. Create a `boolean` that is `True` and print it.
</p>
<p>
    4. Create a `list` that contains the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, change the 3rd element to 20 and print the `list`.
</p>
<p>
    5. Create a `tuple` that contains the numbers `1, 2, 3`, `unpack` it and print the values on the same line.
</p>
<p>
    6. Create a `set` that contains 7 numbers, but only ends up with the numbers `1, 2 and 3` inside it, print the `set`.
</p>
<p>
    7. Create a `dictionary` that contains the `key-value` pairs `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`, 
    add the `key-value` pair `{'d': 4}` to the `dictionary` and print the `dictionary`.
