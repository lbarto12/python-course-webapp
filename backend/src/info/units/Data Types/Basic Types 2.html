<p>python also has some non-numerical types, such as `str` and `bool`.</p>

<p>
    `str` is a shortened form of `string`, and represents a string of characters, where a `character` 
    is a single letter, number, or symbol. 
</p>
<p>
    In many other languages, a single character is called a `char`.
    However, in python, a single character is a `str` of length 1.
</p>
<p>
    A `str` is created by surrounding a string of characters with either single or double quotes:
</p>
<code><var>x</var> = 'hello world'
<var>y</var> = "hello world"
</code>

<p>
    A `bool` is a shortened form of `boolean`, and represents a value that is either `True` or `False`.
</p>
<p>
    A `bool` is created by assigning either `True` or `False` to a variable name:
</p>
<code><var>x</var> = True
<var>y</var> = False
</code>

<p>Given the variabes `x` and `y`, print the types of `x` and `y` on a single line.</p>
