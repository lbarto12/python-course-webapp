    We can also store `Booleans` in variables. This works much the same as creating a variable for a number or string.
</p>
<code><var>is_true</var> = <fun>True</fun>
</code>

<p>
    We can also `initialize` boolean variables by comparing two values. For example, we can compare two numbers to see if one is greater than the other:  
</p>
<code><var>is_greater</var> = 10 > 5 <cmt># is_greater is True</cmt>
</code>

<p>
    Given two numbers `a` and `b`, try storing whether `a` is `less than` than `b` in a variable, then print the variable.
