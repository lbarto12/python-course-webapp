    As we discussed previously, `Booleans` are a data type that can only have two values: `True` or `False`. 
    In Python, we can use `Booleans` to compare values and change the result of our code based on these comparisons. 
    For example, we can compare two numbers to see if one is greater than the other: 
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(10 > 5) <cmt># prints: True</cmt></code>

<p>
    There are many different comparison operators we can use to compare values.
    Here is a list of the most common comparison operators:
</p>
<code><var>a</var> == <var>b</var> <cmt># a is equal to b</cmt>
<var>a</var> != <var>b</var> <cmt># a is not equal to b</cmt>
<var>a</var> < <var>b</var> <cmt># a is less than b</cmt>
<var>a</var> > <var>b</var> <cmt># a is greater than b</cmt>
<var>a</var> <= <var>b</var> <cmt># a is less than OR equal to b</cmt>
<var>a</var> >= <var>b</var> <cmt># a is greater than OR equal to b</cmt>
</code>

<p>
    Given two numbers `a` and `b`, try printing whether `a` is equal to `b`.
