<p>
    The `else` statement is used to execute code when the `if` statement is `False`.
    Else statements are optional, and don't require a condition.
</p>
<code><kwd>if</kwd> 5 > 2:
    <fun>print</fun>("Five is greater than two!")
<kwd>else</kwd>:
    <fun>print</fun>("Five is not greater than two!")
</code>

<p>
    An `important note` is that else will execute in ANY case where the `if` statement is `False`. in the following code,
    the else statement will print `B is greater` even though the numbers compared are the same value.
</p>
<code><var>a</var>, <var>b</var> = 5, 5
<kwd>if</kwd> <var>a</var> > <var>b</var>:
    <fun>print</fun>(<str>"A is greater"</str>)
<kwd>else</kwd>:
    <fun>print</fun>(<str>"B is greater"</str>)
</code>

<p>
    With the else statement we can finish the program we started in the previous slide.
</p>
<p>
    Add an `else` statement to the program that prints `A is not greater` if `a` is not greater than `b`.
