    Now that we have covered the basics of booleans, let's wrap up this unit with a skill assessment.
</p>

<p>
    In some places, there are schools that go from grade 1 - 6, known as elementary schools.
</p>

<p>
    High schools in similar places go from grade 9 - 12.
</p>

<p>
    This means that if a student is in grade 7 or 8, they are in middle school. 
</p>

<p>
    Write a program that prints the school level of a student, given their grade. 
</p>

<p>
    Print `Elementary` If the student is in grage 1 - 6. If the student is in grade 7 or 8, print `Middle`. If the student is in grade 9 - 12, print `High`.
