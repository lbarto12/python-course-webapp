    Now let's test your knowledge of `basic boolean concepts`.
</p>


<p>
    You are working at an amusement park, and you need to write a program to determine if a person is allowed to ride a roller coaster.
</p>
<p>
    Given an `age` and a `required_age`, write a program that prints 
    `You may ride` if the person is old enough, and `You may not ride` if the person is too young.
</p>
<p>
    However, if the person is `exactly` the `required age`, print `Happy birthday!`.
