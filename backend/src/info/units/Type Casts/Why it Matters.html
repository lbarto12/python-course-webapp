    `Type Casting` is mostly important when combining and comparing different data types. 
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you try to add a string and a number, you will get an error.
</p>
<code><var>x</var> = "20"
<var>y</var> = 5
<var>z</var> = <var>x</var> + <var>y</var> <cmt># error</cmt>
</code>

<p>
    Even more confusingly, if you try to `multiply` a `string` by a `number`, 
    you will actually get a valid but completely different interpretation of the expression:
</p>
<code><var>x</var> = "20"
<var>y</var> = 5
<fun>print</fun>(<var>x</var> * <var>y</var>) <cmt># prints: 2020202020</cmt>
<fun>print</fun>(<fun>int</fun>(<var>x</var>) * <var>y</var>) <cmt># prints: 100</cmt>
</code>

<p>
    What is most important to remember, is that if you are unsure of the `type` of a variable, 
    you probably haven't `typed` your variables well enough. Remember too, if you need to be sure,
    you can always use the `type()` function to find out.

    try casting `n` to an `int`, then print the result of `n`.
    Then cast `n` to a `bool` and print the result of `n`.
    Both answers should appear on seperate lines, and use the initial
    value of `n`
