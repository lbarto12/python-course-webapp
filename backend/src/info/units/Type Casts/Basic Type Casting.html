    `Type Casting` refers to changing an entity of one data type into another. 
    Basic type casting can be very useful, and is sometimes required when working with
    different data types or user input.
</p>
<p>
    for example, user input is always a string, but sometimes we need to use it as a number. to do so, we can use the `int()` function.
</p>
<code><var>response</var> = <fun>input</fun>("what is your age?")
<var>response</var> = <fun>int</fun>(<var>response</var>)
</code>

<p>
    Most types can be cast into other types, irrespective of where they come from or are stored
</p>
<code><var>x</var> = "20.5"
<var>y</var> = <fun>float</fun>(<var>x</var>)
<var>z</var> = <fun>int</fun>(<var>x</var>)
</code>

<p>
    Some casts have different behaviour depending on the type of the entity being cast. take, for example, casting a `boolean` to an `int`.
    if the boolean is `True`, the result will be `1`, and if it is `False`, the result will be `0`.
</p>
<code><var>x</var> = <kwd>True</kwd>
<var>y</var> = <fun>int</fun>(<var>x</var>)
<fun>print</fun>(<var>y</var>) <cmt># prints 1</cmt>
</code>

<p>
    This occurs because `True` and `False` are actually just `1` and `0` in disguise. we can even use them as numbers to prove this point
</p>
<code><var>x</var> = <kwd>True</kwd>
<var>y</var> = <kwd>True</kwd>
<var>z</var> = <var>x</var> + <var>y</var>
<fun>print</fun>(<var>z</var>) <cmt># prints 2</cmt>
</code>

<p>
    Given `n`, try casting it to an int, then print the result of `n` squared (remember your operators!)
