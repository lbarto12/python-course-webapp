    Operations also have a default priority, which is the order in which they are evaluated. These rules are generally the same as in math.
</p>
<code>priority | operation
---------|----------
1        | parentheses
2        | exponentiation
3        | multiplication, division, remainder
4        | addition, subtraction
</code>

<p>
    This means that if you have a statement like `1 + 2 * 3`, Python will evaluate the multiplication first, 
    then the addition; because multiplication has a higher priority than addition.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(1 - 2 * 3) <cmt># prints -5</cmt></code>
<p>
    But we can change the order in which Python evaluates a statement by using parentheses.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>((1 - 2) * 3) <cmt># prints -3</cmt></code>

<p>
    modify the given print statement so that it prints `20`. it currently prints `14`.
