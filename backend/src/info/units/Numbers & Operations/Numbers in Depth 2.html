<p>
    There are 3 more complex operations that can be performed on numbers, these are:
</p>

<p>
    The `%` operator, this operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation.
    This is also known as the modulo operator.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(1 % 2) <cmt># prints: 1</cmt></code>
<p>
    The `//` operator, this operator is used to find the result of a division operation, 
    rounded down to the nearest `integer`.
    This operator is also known as the `floor division` operator.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(1 // 2) <cmt># prints: 0</cmt></code>
<p>
    The `**` operator, this operator is used to find the power of a number.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(2 ** 2) <cmt># prints: 4</cmt></code>

<p>
    Given `a` and `b`, try printing the following on seperate lines:
</p>
<code>a % b
a // b
a ** b
</code>
