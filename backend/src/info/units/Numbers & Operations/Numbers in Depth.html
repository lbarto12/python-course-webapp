<p>
    In this module we will delve in depth into the different types of numbers that are available in python,
    and the operations that can be performed on them.
</p>
<p>
    We previously covered the `int` and `float` types, but we haven't touched on operations surrounding them.
</p>
<p>
    The `+` operator, this operator is used to add two numbers together.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(1 + 2) <cmt># prints: 3</cmt></code>
</code>

<p>
    The `-` operator, this operator is used to subtract two numbers.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(1 - 2) <cmt># prints: -1</cmt></code>

<p>
    The `*` operator, this operator is used to multiply two numbers.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(1 * 2) <cmt># prints: 2</cmt></code>

<p>
    The `/` operator, this operator is used to divide two numbers.
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(1 / 2) <cmt># prints: 0.5</cmt></code>

<p>
    Given `a` and `b`, try printing the following on seperate lines:
</p>
<code>a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
</code>
