    We have discussed many operations that can be performed on numbers, now let's put them all together.
</p>
<p>
    perform the following steps on a in this order:
</p>

<p>
    1. add `5` to `a`
</p>
<p>
    2. multiply `a` by `2`
</p>
<p>
    3. subtract `3` from `a`
</p>
<p>
    4. divide `a` by `2`
</p>
<p>
    5. raise `a` to the power of `3`
</p>
<p>
    6. floordiv `a` by `2`
</p>
<p>
    7. `unpack` the result of `divmod` on `a` and `3` into two variables and print them on the same line.
</p>
<p>
    8. print the `binary representation` of the `quotient` returned from the `divmod` call. 
    (you will need to cast the `quotient` to an `int`, you can do so by calling `int` on the `quotient`):
</p>
<code><fun>print</fun>(<fun>bin</fun>(<fun>int</fun>(<var>quotient</var>)))
</code>
<p>
    your answers to `7` and `8` should be on seperate lines.
